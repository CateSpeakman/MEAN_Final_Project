## Harvey Lake Dragon Boats

This is the client side portion of the final project for Hartcode Academy. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.5.

## Front End server

To start the front end server enter the following command in the CMD
```
$ ng serve
```
Once the server has compiled, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in the web browser.

Any changes made to the file within the project will cause the application to automatically reload.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
